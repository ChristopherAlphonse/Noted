## Planned (v2.1) - Infrastructure & DevOps

### Docker & Container Strategy

**Priority:** HIGH
**Status:** Planned

#### Local Development with Docker

- [ ] Create `docker-compose.yml` for local development environment
- [ ] Multi-service setup:
  - MongoDB container
  - Redis container (for caching/sessions)
  - MinIO container (object storage)
  - Server container (hot-reload enabled)
  - Client container (Vite dev server)
- [ ] Volume mounting for hot-reload development
- [ ] Network configuration for service communication
- [ ] Environment variable management via `.env` files
- [ ] Health checks for all services
- [ ] Scripts: `pnpm docker:dev`, `pnpm docker:stop`, `pnpm docker:clean`

**Benefits:**

- Consistent development environment across team
- Easy onboarding for new developers
- Production-like environment locally
- No need to install MongoDB, Redis, MinIO locally

**Files to Create:**

```
docker-compose.yml
docker-compose.dev.yml
apps/server/Dockerfile.dev
apps/client/Dockerfile.dev
.dockerignore
scripts/docker-dev.sh
```

#### MinIO Object Storage Integration

**Priority:** HIGH
**Status:** Planned

Replace Cloudinary with self-hosted MinIO for file storage:

- [ ] Set up MinIO in Docker container
- [ ] Create MinIO service configuration
- [ ] Install MinIO SDK: `@minio/minio-js`
- [ ] Create file upload service: `apps/server/src/services/storageService.ts`
- [ ] Implement file upload endpoints
- [ ] Add file deletion/management
- [ ] Create presigned URL generation for private files
- [ ] Set up bucket policies and access control
- [ ] Add file size and type validation
- [ ] Implement image optimization (sharp integration)
- [ ] Update file upload UI components

**Configuration:**

```typescript
// apps/server/src/config/storage.ts
export const storageConfig = {
  endPoint: process.env.MINIO_ENDPOINT || 'localhost',
  port: parseInt(process.env.MINIO_PORT || '9000'),
  useSSL: process.env.MINIO_USE_SSL === 'true',
  accessKey: process.env.MINIO_ACCESS_KEY,
  secretKey: process.env.MINIO_SECRET_KEY,
};
```

**Buckets:**

- `noted-avatars` - User profile pictures
- `noted-attachments` - Note attachments
- `noted-public` - Public assets

**Benefits:**

- No third-party dependency (Cloudinary)
- Better cost control
- Full data ownership
- Faster local development
- S3-compatible API

#### Structured Logging with @calphonse/logger

**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Status:** Planned

Replace console.log with structured logging:

- [ ] Install `@calphonse/logger`
- [ ] Create logging configuration: `apps/server/src/config/logger.ts`
- [ ] Replace all `console.log` with logger
- [ ] Set up log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
- [ ] Add request ID tracking
- [ ] Implement log rotation
- [ ] Add performance monitoring logs
- [ ] Create log aggregation strategy
- [ ] Set up log viewers (development)
- [ ] Configure different outputs per environment

**Implementation:**

```typescript
// apps/server/src/config/logger.ts
import { createLogger } from '@calphonse/logger';

export const logger = createLogger({
  level: process.env.LOG_LEVEL || 'info',
  format: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? 'json' : 'pretty',
  outputs: [
    { type: 'console' },
    { type: 'file', path: 'logs/app.log' },
    { type: 'file', path: 'logs/error.log', level: 'error' },
  ],
});
```

**Usage Examples:**

```typescript
logger.info('User logged in', { userId: user._id, ip: req.ip });
logger.error('Database connection failed', { error: err.message });
logger.debug('Token refresh initiated', { userId });
```

**Benefits:**

- Structured, searchable logs
- Better debugging in production
- Performance monitoring
- Security audit trails
- Integration with log management tools
