## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Apply a Label
On any pull request, simply apply one of the review labels:
- `copilot-review`
- `github-actions-review`
- `coderabbitai-review`

### 2. Automatic Trigger
The corresponding automated review will start immediately when the label is applied.

### 3. Review Results
Each review will:
- ✅ Post detailed analysis as a PR comment
- 🏷️ Automatically remove the trigger label when complete
- 📊 Add completion labels (e.g., `copilot-reviewed`)
- 📈 Provide actionable recommendations

### 4. Re-trigger if Needed
You can re-apply any label at any time to trigger additional reviews after making changes.

### Workflow Configuration
The automated workflows are configured to:
- **Run on Label Application**: Only triggered when you apply the labels
- **Analyze Changed Files**: Focus on files modified in the PR
- **Provide Actionable Feedback**: Specific suggestions for improvement
- **Auto-cleanup**: Remove trigger labels and add completion labels

## 🎯 When to Use Each Review

| Scenario | Recommended Review | Why |
|----------|-------------------|-----|
| New feature development | `copilot-review` | Comprehensive analysis with AI suggestions |
| Pre-deployment checks | `github-actions-review` | Build validation and security audit |
| Code quality improvements | `coderabbitai-review` | Detailed line-by-line feedback |
| Security-focused changes | `coderabbitai-review` + `copilot-review` | Multiple security analysis approaches |
| Performance optimization | `copilot-review` | Performance pattern detection |
| Large refactoring | All three | Comprehensive coverage from multiple angles |

## 🔄 Workflow Integration

### With CI/CD Pipeline
The automated reviews integrate seamlessly with your existing CI/CD:
- Reviews run in parallel with other checks
- Results appear as PR comments for easy review
- Status checks can be configured to require review completion

### With Team Workflow
- **Self-Review**: Apply labels to get AI feedback before requesting human review
- **Pre-Merge**: Use `github-actions-review` to ensure deployment readiness
- **Learning**: Use `copilot-review` to learn best practices and improve coding skills
- **Security**: Apply `coderabbitai-review` for security-critical changes

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Label Removal**: Labels are automatically removed after review completion
2. **Multiple Reviews**: You can apply multiple labels to get different perspectives
3. **Re-triggering**: Re-apply labels after making changes to get updated analysis
4. **Completion Labels**: Look for `*-reviewed` labels to see which reviews have been completed
5. **Review History**: All review comments remain in the PR for future reference

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Review Not Triggering
- Ensure you're applying the exact label name (case-sensitive)
- Check that GitHub Actions are enabled for the repository
- Verify you have appropriate permissions to apply labels

### Review Failed
- Check the Actions tab for detailed error logs
- Ensure the branch is up to date with the target branch
- Verify all required dependencies are available

### Missing Analysis
- Some analysis may be skipped if no relevant files changed
- Apply labels after pushing changes to analyze the latest code
- Check that file types are supported by the review configuration
